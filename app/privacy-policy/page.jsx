          <p className="mb-4">
            This privacy notice applies to individuals who enquire about, purchase or make use of our products and services, such as when a user signs up with AVENA, modifies his/her account, makes a

          </p>
          <p className="mb-4">

            delete, restrict the use of, object to the use of, port to another person, and withdraw consent to the use of, your information. Exceptions may apply to these rights.
          </p>
